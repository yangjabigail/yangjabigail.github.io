    <p>This song was inspired with a battle with thrips, which are tiny, sap-sucking insects that can cause significant damage to plants.
      As a child, my parents always warned me to wash fruit and avoid eating any produce that could have had pesticides. In high school biology, you also learn that pesticides can have a huge ripple effect across ecosystems.
      This led me to always feel hesitant to use pesticides, but after researching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrips" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thrips</a>, I found that usually some sort of intervention would be necessary to save my peace lily. </p>
      <p>
I ultimately decided to use a natural pesticide called spinosad, which is derived from a soil bacterium and is considered safe for use around pets and children.
      However, even this "organic" solution can be very harmful to bees and other beneficial insects.

      </p>
      <p>
Not wanting to take any chances, I tried to isolate the plant and spray a mixture in the bathroom, away from anything living.
      However, I couldn't help but feel guilty -- if it were any other creature, this pesticide could be considered cruel.
